                      .. hopefully i will be able to do it . Java script to be honest straight scares me cause languages are quiet hard, 
                    I still remember studying Java , I used to not understand little things like loops static and get soo maddd
                  and frustrated and now it feels super easy but noww i dont understand GUI and stuff and its the same story.
                I think the knowledge in this world is Unimaginable and you gonna get stuck but once u reach the next level
              the feeling is amazing and makes it all worth while.</strong></p>

                      was in 5 th std was through football . it really meant a lot to me even though it was just 500 rs.
                      The
                      funny thing is i got my right hand majorly fractured and dislocated while playing DSO and after recovering 
                      i love playing football even more ,
                       Maybe its because
                        i understand the gift god gave me of football
                      while i was in the hospital admitted , or maybe i am just stupid , WILL never know
